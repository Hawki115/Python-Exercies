## 💡 What's This Repo?

This is a personal collection of Python practice problems — mostly from:

- 🧠 [Zero to Mastery: Complete Python Developer](https://zerotomastery.io/) course
- 💡 My own ideas, challenges, and mini-projects
- 🤔 Things I wanted to try, re-do, or understand better

I use this as a space to:

- Build muscle memory with Python
- Track my progress
- Experiment without pressure
- Reinforce core concepts with hands-on practice
